    "## 1. Problem Formulation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"problem_formulation\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in developing a model is to formulate the problem in a way that we can apply machine learning. In here, the task is to predict the **presence or absence of diabetes** using various health metrics and demographic information of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem type, the training dataset, and the `code_book.txt`, we can see that:\n",
    "- This is a `Supervised Learning` and specifically, `Binary Classification` problem since the training data contains the `Status` column representing the occurance of diabetes, which is also what we are trying to predict (0 for absence and 1 for presence)\n",
    "- In the training dataset, there are in total 25 columns, in which:\n",
    "  - The `Id` column will not be used since it does not contribute to the occurance of diabetes\n",
    "  - The `Status` column will be used as the target variable for the training process\n",
    "  - The remaining 23 columns are the attributes and will be used for the data analyzing and training processes\n",
    "- Data structure:\n",
    "  - There are 8 ordinal attributes namely GenHlth (1 - 5), MentHlth (1 - 30), PhysHlth (1 - 30), Age (1 - 13), Education (1 - 6), Income (1 - 8), ExtraMedTest (-199, 199), ExtraAlcoholTest (-199, 199)\n",
    "  - BMI is the only continuous attribute\n",
    "  - The remaining 14 features are binary attributes, which can only be either 0 or 1"

    "### 2.1. Descriptive Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the training dataset into a `Pandas DataFrame`, we can extract some information using `.shape` and `.describe` methods. Based on output[2], we can see that:\n",
    "- Our dataset has in total 202,944 rows (records) and 24 columns (23 of which are attributes and the `Status` column as the expected output)\n",
    "- There are **no missing values** in the dataset since all columns have exactly 202,944 rows\n",
    "- The percentage of people suffering from High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol are nearly the same at about 42%\n",
    "- BMI, **the only continuous attribute**, has values ranging from 12 to 98. The average BMI is 28.38, which is relatively high [ref](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/)\n",
    "- Most people had Cholesterol Check (96%) and Health Care Coverage (95%)\n",
    "- There are minor of people suffered from Stroke (4%), Heavy Alcohol Consump (6%), No Doctor because of Cost (8%), Heart Disease and Attack (9%), and Walking Difficulty (17%)\n",
    "- There are more than a half of people having a healthy lifestyle with Physical Activity at 76%, Fruits Consume at 64%, and Veggies Consume at 81%\n",
    "- Surprisingly, the statistics of ExtraMedTest and ExtraAlcoholTest are nearly the same\n",
    "- Only 18% of people suffering from Diabetes (The Target variable)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Variable Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to statistic features provided by `Pandas`, we can also use `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to visualize different attributes in the dataset. We begin by plotting the `histogram` to see the data distribution of each attribute [ref](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/histogra.htm) and after that, we use `box plot` to see the variation of information [ref](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/boxplot.htm)\n",
