    "## 1. Problem Formulation <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"problem_formulation\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in developing a model is to formulate the problem in a way that we can apply machine learning. In here, the task is to predict the **presence or absence of diabetes** using various health metrics and demographic information of individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem type, the training dataset, and the `code_book.txt`, some information we can get are:\n",
    "- This is a `Supervised Learning` and specifically, `Binary Classification` problem since the training data contains the `Status` column representing the occurance of diabetes, which is also what we are trying to predict (0 for absence and 1 for presence)\n",
    "- In the training dataset, there are in total 25 columns, in which:\n",
    "  - The `Id` column will not be used since it does not contribute to the occurance of diabetes\n",
    "  - The `Status` column will be used as the target variable for the training process\n",
    "  - The remaining 23 columns are the attributes and will be used for the data analyzing and training processes\n",
    "- Data attribute types:\n",
    "  - There are 8 `ordinal attributes` namely GenHlth (1 - 5), MentHlth (1 - 30), PhysHlth (1 - 30), Age (1 - 13), Education (1 - 6), Income (1 - 8), ExtraMedTest (-199, 199), ExtraAlcoholTest (-199, 199)\n",
    "  - BMI is the only `continuous attribute`\n",
    "  - The remaining 14 features are `binary attributes`, which can only be either 0 or 1"

    "## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis <a id=\"EDA\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will work on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a crucial step in the data analysis that allows us to gain insights into the structure, distribution, and relationships of different attributes within our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Descriptive Statistic <a id=\"DS\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the training dataset into a `Pandas DataFrame`, we can extract some information using `.shape` and `.describe` methods. Based on `output[2]`, we can see that:\n",
    "- Our dataset has in total 202,944 rows (records) and 24 columns (23 of which are attributes and the `Status` column as the expected output)\n",
    "- There are **no missing values** in the dataset since all columns have exactly 202,944 rows\n",
    "- The percentage of people suffering from High Blood Pressure and High Cholesterol are nearly the same at about 42%\n",
    "- BMI has values ranging from 12 to 98. The average BMI is 28.38, which is relatively high [ref](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/)\n",
    "- Most people had Cholesterol Check (96%) and Health Care Coverage (95%)\n",
    "- There are minor of people suffered from Stroke (4%), Heavy Alcohol Consump (6%), No Doctor because of Cost (8%), Heart Disease and Attack (9%), and Walking Difficulty (17%)\n",
    "- There are more than a half of people having a healthy lifestyle with Physical Activity at 76%, Fruits Consume at 64%, and Veggies Consume at 81%\n",
    "- Surprisingly, the statistics of ExtraMedTest and ExtraAlcoholTest are nearly the same\n",
    "- **Only 18% of people suffered from Diabetes (The Target variable)**, we can then conclude that we are having an `imbalance dataset`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Variable Distributions <a id=\"VD\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to statistic features provided by `Pandas`, we can also use `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to visualize different attributes in the dataset. We begin by plotting the `histogram` to see the data distribution of each attribute [ref](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/histogra.htm) and after that, we use `box plot` to see the variation of information [ref](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/boxplot.htm) \n",
    "\n",
    "Using histogram (`output[4]`), we can see that:\n",
    "- ExtraMedTest and ExtraAlcoholTest are relatively similar to each other and have a **symmetrical distribution**\n",
    "- BMI is **right skewed** with the majority falls between 20 and 30\n",
    "- HighBP, HighChol, Smoker, and Sex are **balance**, while CholCheck, Stroke, AnyHealthCare, NoDocbcCost, MentHlth, PhysHlth, DiffWalk, Education, Income, and Status are **imbalance**\n",
    "- In MentHlth and PhysHlth, the value of 30 gets surprisingly higher compared to previous values close to it. It is possible that someone, in the past 30 days, did not have a good mental/physical health experience, so we can conclude that this is not a data error\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, with box plot (`output[5]`), we can see that:\n",
    "- There are a lot of outliers in BMI (from 40 to 100), MentHlth (from 5 to 30), and PhysHlth (from 7 to 30). However, it is possible that someone has BMI up to 100 [ref]() and someone has a 30 days unwell. We can conclude that these outliers are not data collection error and will keep all of them\n",
    "- Some outliers occuring in **binary attributes** like CholCheck, Stroke, HeartDiseaseorAttack, PhysActivity, Veggies, HvyAlcoholConsump, AnyHealthcare, NoDocbcCost, GenHlth, DiffWalk indicate that there are some imbalance between the two binary classes\n",
    "- On the other hand, the box plots of HighBP, HighChol, Smoker, Fruits, and Sex show that there is a balance distribution between the values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Correlation Analysis <a id=\"CA\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to visualizing data distribution, we can also display the correlation between different columns of the dataset. From `output[7]`, we can see that:\n",
    "- Some high correlated columns are:\n",
    "  - GenHlth and PhysHlth: 0.53\n",
    "  - GenHlth and DiffWalk: 0.46\n",
    "  - DiffWalk and PhysHlth: 0.48\n",
    "  - GenHlth and Income: -0.37\n",
    "  - Status and ExtraMedTest: 0.5\n",
    "  - Status and ExtraAlcoholTest: 0.5\n",
    "- CholCheck, Smoker, Stroke, Fruits, Veggies, HvyAlcoholConsump, AnyHealthcare, NoDocbcCost, MentHlth, and Sex are low correlated with `Status`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Feature Engineering <a id=\"FE\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a crucial step in optimizing the performance of machine learning models. In this section, we delve into several key aspects of feature engineering, including normalization, handling skewed attributes, and addressing duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Normalization`: As our dataset has variables with different value range, we will use **Min-Max scaling** to transform the data to a standardized range between 0 and 1. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the analysis and a faster training process. `output[8]` displays the data distribution after the normalizing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling skewed attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "- About outliers: As stated in previous sections, outliers \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, and visualize patterns in the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle missing values, outliers, and perform necessary data preprocessing steps\n"
